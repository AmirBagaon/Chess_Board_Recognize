# Chess_Board_Recognize

Detecting chess board on the screen,
Determines it's FEN, and provides the next best move!

Watch the attached video.

For now, to determine the next best move,
It works best with a local repo of Chess_Web (https://github.com/AmirBagaon/Chess_Web),
But can also work with http://chessweb.pythonanywhere.com/.

Enjoy!
